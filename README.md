> # DomainInfo
Hello, today we are back with the DomainInfo code. This code performs IP and domain scanning services. It shows information such as the country, city, region, and even if the server is a subdomain and the servers that that IP is on. To use the first code, you must install Python on your system. After installing Python on your system, enter it in your system search pip install requests You enter and wait for the home book to be installed.

After installing the home book, turn on the code and enter your IP or domain to start the search.

If you encounter any problems while using the code, open a ticket on our Discord and share it with our support team.
